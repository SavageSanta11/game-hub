- cool because you have complete ownership of the component 
- can use and modify and add your own variants coz the css has already been provided to you


Routing Concepts

- the app folder is a special reserved folder in Next.js which is used for routing 
- page is a reserved filenes which tells next.js that this is a file we want to show to the client  - app/foo.tsx wont be a valid route
- if we don't have a default export in page.tsx then it wont be recognized as a valid component
- if you want to create another valid client route then you have to create a folder within app and then have a page.tsx inside it. For example:
    1. app/folder/page.tsx => localhost:3000/folder
    2. app/folder/onemorefolder/page.tsx => localhost:3000/folder/onemorefolder

- but if you change the folder naming to (auth) from auth for example
    1. app/(auth)/login => localhost:3000/login

- 'route' is a reserved filename for creating API routes - put all routes in a route.ts file
- layout renders your actual content in the HTML structure
    1. we can also create our own layouts
    2. this is useful when we want certain routes to have certain layouts - like auth/login should maybe not have an account navbar whereas some other route should

- server components
    1. backend behaviour
    2. database access
    3. server cache
    4. streaming
    5. partial rendering
    6. seo
    7. initial page load

- client components
    1. frontend behaviour
    2. useEffect
    3. useState
    4. onClick

5. _ before a folder name means it is reserved - it won matter if you have a page.tsx => next.js wont put this folder in the routing system


6. you can requst a specific subdomain on localtunel using: lt --port 3000 --subdomain pink

7. the purpose of the clerk webhooks is to ensure that only those users who have been authenticated can access information from the database  - done using clerk and svix
    a. otherwise anyone without the right headers, svix id etc, can access that data
    b. so we check if te user triggering the endpoint doesn't haave the svix and id and headers, then we throw an error

6. all components created inside app folder are server componenets by default. they need to specified othersie if you want them to be client components
